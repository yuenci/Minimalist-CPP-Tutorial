### Program Structure

```c++
#include <iostream> // import library about IO
using namespace std; //  Import all identifiers in the namespace.

int main() { // program is executed from here
  cout << "Hello, world!";  // print "hello world"
  return 0; // end without any issue
}
```



### Comments

1. Single-line

```c++
// I am a single-line comment
```

2. Multi-line

```c++
/* 
I am a
multi-line
comment
*/
```



### Input and Output

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int age;
	cout << "How old are you?" << endl;
	cin >> age;
	cout << "You are " << age << " years old.";

	return 0;
}
```

`std::cout` is the “character output stream” and it is used to write to the standard output. It is followed by the symbols `<<` and the value to be displayed.

`endl` is used for new line, you can also use "\n", there are only some performance differences between them.

`std::cin`, which stands for “character input”, reads user input from the keyboard.



### Variables

```c++
// Declare a variable
int score;

// Initialize a variable
score = 0;
```



### Data type

1. int Type

```c++
int year = 1991;
int age = 28;
```

2. double Type

```c++

double price = 8.99;
double pi = 3.14159;
```

3. char Type

```c++
char grade = 'A';
char punctuation = '?';
```

4. string Type

```c++
std::string message = "good nite";
std::string user = "codey";
```

5. bool Type

```c++
bool organ_donor = true;
bool late_to_work = false;
```



### Arithmetic Operators

```c++
int x = 0;

x = 4 + 2;  // x is now 6
x = 4 - 2;  // x is now 2
x = 4 * 2;  // x is now 8
x = 4 / 2;  // x is now 2
x = 4 % 2;  // modulo, x is now 0
```
