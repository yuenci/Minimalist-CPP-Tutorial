### Why C++?

- C++ is developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1979.
- C++ adds object-oriented programming and many other new features to C.
- C++ is fast, flexible, and well-supported across multiple platforms.
- Being one of the most popular languages today, C++ has a wide range of applications across many fields.

### C++ Style Guide

*Style* is what we call the conventions that govern our C++ code. These rules exist to keep the code base manageable and readable.

Here are some basic tips from Google’s C++ Style Guide[^2]:

- `#include` statements are mostly written **at the beginning** of any C/C++ program.
- Names can never start with a digit or be the same as a predefined C++ keyword.
- Types, variable, operators, and literal values should be separated by **one space horizontally**.
- Classes, functions, and global variables should be separated by **one space vertically**.
- All indentations should be **two spaces** at a time.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// This program print out “Hello World!”
int main() {
  string message = "Hello World!\n";
  cout << message;
  return 0;
}
```



## Compile and Execute C++ with Visual Studio

1. Open Visual Studio and create a new C++ project. You can do this by clicking on "File" -> "New" -> "Project" and selecting "C++" from the list of project types.
2. Write your C++ code in the editor. You can create a new source file by right-clicking on the project name in the Solution Explorer and selecting "Add" -> "New Item" -> "C++ File".
3. Once you have written your code, you can compile it by clicking on "Build" -> "Build Solution" or by pressing the F7 key. This will create an executable file in the "Debug" or "Release" folder in your project directory, depending on your build configuration.
4. To execute the program, you can either click on "Debug" -> "Start Without Debugging" or press the Ctrl+F5 key combination. This will launch the program in the console window.
5. If you need to pass command-line arguments to the program, you can do so by right-clicking on the project name in the Solution Explorer and selecting "Properties". In the "Debugging" tab, you can specify the command-line arguments in the "Command Arguments" field.

By following these steps, you can easily compile and execute your C++ programs using Visual Studio[^3].
