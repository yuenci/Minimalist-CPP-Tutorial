### Introduction to Functions

A *function* in C++ contains a set of instructions that are executed when it is called.

A function declaration is composed of three parts:

1. Function return type
2. Function name
3. Function parameters

```c++
<return type>  <name>()  <parameters>{
    //function body
}
```

A function can be called by specifying its name followed by a pair of parentheses `()`.

```c++
#include <iostream>

void printTitle(int num) {
  std::string msg = "this is: ";
  std::cout << msg << num;
}

int main(){
  printTitle(5);
  return 0;
}

// Output: this is: 5
```

### Function declaration

In C++, you need to declare a function before you can use it because C++ is a statically typed language. This means that the compiler needs to know the data types of all variables and functions in a program at compile-time, before the program is executed.

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


int main() {
	
	hello("c++");
	return 0;
}

void hello(string name) {
	cout << "hello " << name;
}
```

This function above will generate an error, because the compiler runs to `hello()` , it doesn't know the existence of this function, because it was not declared before, which leads to an error.



```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void hello(string); // declare  function
    
int main() {
	
	hello("c++");
	return 0;
}

void hello(string name) {
	cout << "hello " << name;
}
```

So We should declare function before we use it



**Why can the following function run without declaration?**

```c++
#include <iostream>

void printTitle() {
  std::string msg = "Hello world";
  std::cout << msg;
}

int main(){
  printTitle();

  return 0;
}

```

Use a function without declaring it first in c++, this is called "implicit function declaration", and it was allowed in older versions of C++. However, it is not recommended because it can lead to hard-to-debug errors, and it is not allowed in modern C++. It's always best to declare your functions before you use them to avoid any potential issues.





### Passing Parameters by Value 

When passing parameters by value, a copy of the argument value is created and passed to the function. Any changes made to the parameter inside the function are not reflected outside the function

```c++
#include <iostream>

void increment(int x) {
  x++;
  std::cout << "Inside the function, x is: " << x << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  int num = 5;
  increment(num);
  std::cout << "Outside the function, num is: " << num << std::endl;
  return 0;
}

// Output: 
// Inside the function, x is: 6
// Outside the function, num is: 5
```

The result shows that the value of `num` outside the function has not been changed by the function call.



### Passing Parameters by Reference

When passing parameters by reference, a reference to the argument value is passed to the function. This allows the function to modify the original value of the argument.
```c++
#include <iostream>

void increment(int& x) {
  x++;
  std::cout << "Inside the function, x is: " << x << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  int num = 5;
  increment(num);
  std::cout << "Outside the function, num is: " << num << std::endl;
  return 0;
}

// Output:
// Inside the function, x is: 6
// Outside the function, num is: 6
```

[Open in Playground↗](http://tpcg.io/J2WR8W)

This shows that the value of `num` outside the function has been changed by the function call, because the function was able to modify the original value of `num` using the reference passed to it.







### Function Overloading

With *function overloading*, C++ functions can have the same name but handle different input parameters.

At least one of the following criteria must be true in order for functions to be properly overloaded:

- Each function has different types of parameters.
- Each function has a different number of parameters.

The function return type is NOT used to differentiate overloaded functions.

```c++
#include <iostream>

int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

double add(double a, double b) {
  return a + b;
}

int add(int a, int b, int c) {
  return a + b + c;
}

int main() {
  std::cout << add(3, 2); // Calls add(int, int)
  std::cout << "\n";
  std::cout << add(5.3, 1.4); // Calls add(double, double)
  std::cout << "\n";
  std::cout << add(2, 6, 9);  // Calls add(int, int, int)
}
```
